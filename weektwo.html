        <p>Today, I searched the website of Google Art, and I notice a lot of skills they used to build such website.</p>
        <p>The most obvious factor they use are the hyper link under each picture or master piece of some celebrities.</p>
        <P><strong>For example</strong>, When I searched the 'Portrait of young women', and clicked that picture, it suddenly</P>
        <p>redirected me to another link, and in that link I could find a lot of additional and detailed information about that picture.</p>
        <p>To five an example <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/portrait-of-a-young-woman-supplemental/UAGsuoFcmmRiTg?childAssetId=gwEw8hBfcnN-Jw"><img src="portrait.jpg"></a></p>
