             <h1>That was amazing!!!</h1>
        <p>After visiting the British Museum online. I found it is really interesting and useful for education about humanities.  To make people understand these well, there is 3D for some kinds of relics, which is quite straightforward for poeple to enjoy and learn.</p>
        <strong>Firstly, there are many heritages of culture and art from all over the world.</strong>
        <em>What's more, the display of culture relics is really detailed and clear. For instance, the meterial, the approximate age and style are clearly given in the archive.</em>
