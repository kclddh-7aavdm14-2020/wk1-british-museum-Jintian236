        <p>Today, I searched the website of Google Art, and I notice a lot of skills they used to build such website.</p>
        <p>The most obvious factor they use are the hyper link under each picture or master piece of some celebrities.</p>
        <P><strong>For example</strong>, When I searched the 'Portrait of young women', and clicked that picture, it suddenly-</P>
        <p>-redirected me to another link, and in that link I could find a lot of additional and detailed information about that picture.</p>
        <p>I thouhgt they might use the language ' < a href = ' URL ' >< img src = " xxxxx. j p e g " < / a ></p>
